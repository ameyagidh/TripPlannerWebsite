To better serve people with interests in traveling after the pandemic, our team plans to design and create a user-friendly web application for travelers to easily make visualized travel plans as well as interact with other travelers.

## Implementation Plan

### Proposed Technology Stack:
- **Front End:** React Js
- **Back End:** Node.js (using Express framework)
- **Database:** MongoDB to store user information and tourist spots information, image URLs; image files will be stored in a cloud file system.
- **Deployment:** The service will be deployed to Heroku.

### Main functionalities:
- User register/login/logout using token-based authentication.
- Homepage: tourists spot display on Google Map using Google Map Places API.
- Search for different tourist spots: Implement Map Places API to fetch the address, pictures, and other details for the selected spots and display those information on the detail page of the tourist spots.
- Make travel plans and save them into the database.
- Create a webpage that allows users to post or share their trips, and users can comment on the blog posts created by other users.
- Create POST/GET API that enables users to create and edit profile information in the Private User Profile.
- Create a public profile webpage that fetches data from our local API and display information of the account holder and his/her blog posts.

### External APIs:
- **Google Place API:** Provides users detailed information about the place they intend to visit. Enables users to find specific places with an address or name. Identifies users‚Äô locations based on real-time signals.
- **Google Maps API:** Displays local context.
- **Google Routes API:** Directs users to the destination with reliable and efficient routes.
